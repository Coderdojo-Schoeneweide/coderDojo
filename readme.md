# CoderDojo Schöneweide Website

Welcome to the codebase for the **CoderDojo Schöneweide** website!  
This project is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern frontend framework optimized for fast, content-rich websites.

We are currently in the process of **redesigning the site** based on a new visual direction.  
Designs and prototypes have been created in Figma and are available to all team members (see below).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/majdkt/coderDojo.git
cd coderDojo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321/`

Astro uses file-based routing. Pages live inside the `src/pages/` directory. Components and layouts can be found in `src/components/` and `src/layouts/`.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The website is built using an Astro template, customized to fit the needs of CoderDojo Schöneweide.

We're in the middle of redesigning the website with a fresh look and improved UX. The development work should follow the structure of the new Figma design as closely as possible.

## 🎨 Figma Design Prototypes

All design guidelines, component layouts, and page flows (mobile + desktop) are documented here:
